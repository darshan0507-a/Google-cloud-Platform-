a) Google cloud storage can store any kind of storage like audio,video, excel sheets, unformat data, pictures of any format etc...
b) Bucket name must be unique across all google infrastructure.
c) Bucket has 4 storage class and they complelty depend on Location
   - Types of Storage class 
    1) Standard - Best for short-term storage and frequently accessed data
    2) Nearline - Best for backups and data access once a month.
    3) Coldline - Best for data recovery and accessed less then once a quarter.
    4) Archive - Best for long term and accessed once in a year.
d) Location - It defines the geographial placement of the bucket and its objects.
    Region , DUal region and Multi-region
 
e) Whenever objects leaves the google cloud there will be charge . If you want to retrieve the objects by any appplication or just by manually within google cloud - its all free.
f) By default every object in a bucket is private. We have to make the chnage to make it public.
g) Once the bucket name is set , you wont be able to rename it and you wont be able to change location . The only thing you can do is change the storage class.
h) There are two types of access control in Storage
   - Fine-grained -> Fine-grained means access can be controlled via both buckets and its objects. It will not be necessary if bucket is public then objects will also be public . 
   If you want to make objects public you will have to edit permissions.
   - Uniform -> It means if access control list will be applicable on both bucket and its objects . If bucket is public so will objects be and vice versa.
