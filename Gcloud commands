Basic commands
================
gcloud organizations list - To get list of organizations .
gcloud config list : To know project ID and project name, account name
gcloud config get-value project - To know project (another command)
gcloud config configurations list : To know project ID , zone and region
gcloud config set project <project ID > - To set project in shell
gcloud projects list - List all projects in account
gcloud projects create <Project Name > - There are other flags which can also be used.
gcloud config set project <project name> - To set the project in console to access
After this we need to add billing account to a project
gcloud beta billing accounts list

Compute commands
=================
gcloud services list - To get list of all services running (simply for which services API is turned On)
gcloud services list --enabled - To kist which API are enabled
gcloud services list --available | grep compute - to see API compute
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com - To enable compute API from CLI
gcloud compute zones list  - To list all zones
gcloud compute regions list - To list all regions
gcloud config set compute/region <region Name> - To set region for the project/account
gcloud config set compute/zone <zone Name> - To set zone for the project/account
gcloud compute networks list - To see all network list
gcloud compute networks subnets list - To see all subnets
gcloud compute firewall-rules list - To list all firwall rules
gcloud compute instances list - To get list of compute instances in project.
gcloud compute disks list - To get list of disks used by an instance
gcloud compute snapshots list - To get list of snapshots of disk ( Snapshot - Its a method of saving configuration of instance in disk at a particular tiemframe , its also known as backup)
gcloud compute disks snapshot <disk name> - To get snapshot of disk.

Storage commands : gsutil is a command line tool which we can use to access google cloud storage via cli.
==================
gsutil ls - to list all buckets
gsutil ls gs://<bucketname>/**   - To list all contents in buckets and folders
gsutil mb -c <storageclass name> -l <location name> -p <project-id> gs://<uniqueu bucket name>   - command to create buckets
gsutil cp <bucket1> <bucket2> - to copy from bucket 1 to bucket 2
gsutil help - To get to know more flags or commands
gsutil iam get gs://chitra/ : To see IAM roles and permissions for a bucket
gcloud pubsub topics create $PUB_SUB_TOPIC --project $PROJECT_NAME - Creating a pubsub topic for events and messaging
One command and Pubsub is ready to be used. We jsut need to create a topic

gsutil label commands
======================
gsutil label get gs://bucketname
gsutil label set <bucket.json> gs://bucketname/
gsutil label ch -l "extraparam":"extravalue" gs://bucketname/

versioning commands
==================
gsutil versioning get gs://darshan0507/
gsutil versioning set on gs://darshan0507

control ACL from CLI
======================
gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://bucketname/filename/ - To give read access to public for that object only.






Gcloud compute and services 
==============================
a) Its imporatnt to keep in mind that all projects are isolated entites . Making change to one project won't affect other.
Services service enabling and siabling are project specific.
b) gcloud services list
c) gcloud services list --available
gcloud services list --enabled
d) gcloud services list --available | grep compute
gcloud services list --enabled | grep compute
e) gcloud services enable <api name>
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
c) gcloud compute instances create <VM name>
d) gcloud compute instances delete <VMName>



Using Global flags along with Gcloud command
==============================================

a) Using --project flag
gcloud compute instances list --project=bamboo-antler-286719
b) Using --format flag
gcloud compute instances list --project=bamboo-antler-286719 --format=json
c) Using --filter , --account
gcloud compute instances create myvm --project=bamboo-antler-286719 --format=json
A VM machine will get created and output will be json format which is easy to read and understand.


Using Gcloud properties so we can use flags easily
=================================================
a) Its used very often for account,project,region, and zone.
b) List of properties
  - Set "core/account" or "account" to replace "--account"
  - Set "core/project" or project to replace --project
  - Set "compute/region" to replace --region
  - Set "compute/zone" to replace --zone
  
c) TO set properties -
  gcloud config set <property> <value>
d) TO check the property
  gcloud config get-value <property>
  
e) To remove the property
gcloud config unset <property>

h)
gcloud config set compute/region us-west2
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west2-a
gcloud compute machine-types list --filter="f1-micro AND us-west2-a"
gcloud compute machine-types list --filter=" us-west2-a"

i)
create machine with machine-type flag
========================================
gcloud compute instances create --machine-type f1-micro myhappyvm

MOST IMP : HOW TO PING A VM MACHINE FROM CLOUD SHELL
=================================================
gcloud compute ssh myhappyvm
 Virual machine will have public Key starts with (ssh-rsa) and public and private key will be stored in shell vm (google cloud sheel)
